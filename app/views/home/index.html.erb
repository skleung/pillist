		<h1>Medication organization <i>made simple</i></h1>
			<p class = "description">
			Our company, <strong>Pillist™</strong>, is developing a mobile and web application to help patients better manage their medications by automatically generating a simplified and organized medication list through partnership with the patient’s own pharmacy.

			<h1>Patients need:</h1>
			<strong>a better way of keeping track of their medications.</strong>
			<p>Five common ways patients manage their medications:
			<ul>
				<li>They don't</li>
				<li>Hand-written lists on paper</li>
				<li>Pills boxes</li>
				<li>medicine bottles on hand</li>
				<li>Excel spreadsheets with manually entered data</li>
			</ul> 
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class = "about-list-2">
			<h1>Why is this a problem for patients?</h1>
			<ol>
				<li> It’s hard to remember to take medications consistently at specific times </li>
				<li> Medications may change following a clinic visit or hospitalization</li>
				<li>It can be difficult to remember how to take certain medications (e.g. without food)</li>
				<li> There can be confusion with brand-name and generic medications</li>
				<li> Medications are becoming increasingly specialized as multiple formulations (e.g. extended-
				release) and multiple strengths of the same drug become available </li>
				<li> Keeping track of available refills and when to refill can be challenging</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li class = "about-list-3">
			<h1>The facts:</h1>
			<p> An estimated 

1/3 – 1/2 of U.S. patients do not adhere to prescribed medication regimens. Studies have consistently 

shown that 20% to 30% of prescriptions are never filled by patients. The lack of adherence has dramatic 

effects on health. In the U.S., it is estimated to cause approximately 125,000 deaths, at least 10% of 

hospitalizations, and a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality. 
			</p>

		<li class = "about-list-4">
			<h1>Physicans need:</h1>
			<p>to perform efficient Medication Reconciliations and deliver the

best possible care while caregivers need this information to help the patient take his or her medications.</p>
		</li>

		<li class = "about-list-5">
		<h1>Pharmacies need:</h1>
		<p>
 a better method of communicating with patients and incentivizing them to refill 

prescriptions in order to keep the patients healthy and happy.</p>
		</li>

		<li class = "about-list-6">
		<h1>Our aim:</h1>
		<p> to create a mobile/web application that automatically generates a simplified and organized

medication list that can be shared with the patient’s providers and caregivers, saves time with electronic 

refill capability, and provides a better relationship with a patient’s pharmacy and pharmacist through a 

rewards system.</p>
